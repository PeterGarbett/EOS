A few files to enable control of an external gphoto2 capable
camera. We also have a power supply controlled by a USB relay

The ident for this is currently hard encoded.

Routines for starting and stopping the gui are usefull
here since I can use vnc to view images but want to run
gui-less most of the time

N.B. These routines clear all the photos off the camera!
